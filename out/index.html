The techniques will be showcased using practical applications.</p><h2>Assessment</h2><p>Your grade in the course depends on the result of the following assessments:</p><p>1) Assignment 1: 20%</p><p>2) Midterm Test: 20%</p><p>3) Project: 20%</p><p>4) Final Exam: 40%</p><h2>Lecture Slides</h2><p>A list of lecture slides is available in the discord server</p><h2>Assignments and Projects</h2><p>1) Assignment:TBD</p><p>1) Project: TBD</p><h2>Sample Code</h2><p>The following are links to the <!-- -->[Jupyter notebooks]<!-- --> (<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nuPIMlPOBy-XFg0jXTTVLvg4p7mFM-fF?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nuPIMlPOBy-XFg0jXTTVLvg4p7mFM-fF?usp=sharing</a>) that we used in class.</p><p>The notebooks can be run on <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google colaboratory</a> or you can download them and run them
on your own machine/server.</p><h2>Textbook</h2><p>I will use research papers describing both the background material as well as the
current state of the art.
Students are expected to understand the material as well as being able to implement
simple versions of the described algorithm. </p><p>Some of the lecture material is taken from Sutton and Bartow, Reinforcement Learning:
An Introduction, which is available free of charge from the link <a href="http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html">http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html</a>.</p><h2>Academic Dishonesty</h2><p>Students are reminded that there are penalties for academic dishonesty.
Academic dishonesty includes submitting assignments that are not entirely the studentâ€™s own work.

This sheet must be filled out and attached to all assignments or projects,
which you are submitting as part of your class work.
No assignment or project will be marked unless the declaration is attached.</p><h2>Registration Advisory</h2><p>It is your responsibility to ensure that you are entitled to be registered in this course.
